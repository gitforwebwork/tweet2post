**Overview**
Tweet2Post is a WordPress plugin that allows you to import tweets as posts.

* <strong> A list of hashtags gives control over which tweets are imported.</strong><br />Options include setting a "master hashtag" to import all tweets using that hashtag.
 
* <strong>You can link hashtags to post categories and define a default category for post without a category hashtag.</strong><br>Define as many hashtags for category (or categories for a hashtag) as you like. All tweets will be posted accordingly.

* <strong>You have the option to define a Custom Post Type (and custom categories) for imported tweets.</strong>

* <strong>All posts will use SEFs.</strong><br> A santized version of the tweeted text is used as the Search Engine Friendly URL (slug). This will make it easier for Google to rank the newly created pages.

* <strong>The included Scheduler can be used to import tweets automatically.</strong> The automatic import can be scheduled to run every 1/5/15/30 minutes, as well as hourly and daily. You can also run a manual import from the plugin settings page.
